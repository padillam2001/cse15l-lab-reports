In order to access a remote server through Visual Studio Code, we will follow these steps:

1) Download Visual Studio Code (if not already downloaded)
2) If you're using a non-Unix-based operating system (like Windows), download Git.
3) Access the server through a bash terminal in VSC.

We will now go through each of these steps in mroe depth:

1) 
Visual Studio Code can be downloaded through this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
2)
Git for Windows can be downloaded through this link:https://git-scm.com/download/win

If you are on MacOS, Linux, or any other Unix-based OS, you can skip this step.

3)
Now, open Visual Studio Code and create a terminal by using *Ctrl* + *'*. You will now set your default terminal to the git bash you installed.
Open the command palette by clicking *Ctrl* + *Shift* + *P* and select *Git Bash* from the options. Now, simply click the *+* icon in the terminal you
will have a new git bash terminal.

You are now ready to remote connect to a server!
