Step 6:
``ls <Enter>`` (This allows me to check where I am)

``cd lab7 <Enter>`` (This changes my directory to the cloned repository)

``ls <Enter>`` (This allows me to check where I am and what files there are in my directory)

``<Up>`` x 6
``<Right>`` x 11 (These get me to the right line and character)
``x`` (This deletes the highlighted character)
``i`` (Changes vim to insert mode)
``2`` (Adds a 2)
``<Esc>`` (Exits insert mode)
``:wq!`` ``<Enter>`` (Saves changes)

Step 8:
``<Up>`` x 2
``<Enter>`` (goes up to previous command and runs bash.sh again)
